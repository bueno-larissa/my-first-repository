            This was my trip to Spain. This specific photo was taken in Barcelona, where I also traveled to Madrid, Cullera, Vigo, and Valencia. It was a wonderful experience that allowed me to practice my Spanish with native speakers and enhance my communication skills. The Spanish people are very polite and welcoming, so if you ever visit, be open to receiving hugs and physical contact!

            This photo was taken during my trip to France. I only visited Paris, but it was a fantastic experience. Paris is amazing in the summertime, and the nightlife is vibrant, filled with diverse people and plenty of activities. I would love to go back and live there for a short time. If you decide to visit in the winter, know that all these places are open, but be prepared for the intense cold!

            My experience in Portugal was quite extensive, as part of my family is from there. I had the opportunity to live and work in Portugal for almost two years. It’s a beautiful country with a significant number of immigrants from Brazil and Africa. Living there is quite affordable, and the bakery products are incredibly delicious. All the cities are relatively small, so I recommend visiting as many as possible. Also, be prepared for the wind, as Portugal is famously known for its breezy weather!

          I’m from Brazil, but I haven’t lived there for the past two years. I visit once a year, and last year, I had the chance to explore some of my favorite places. I’d love to share some tips if you ever plan to visit! Be prepared for the intense heat, and don’t forget to engage with Brazilians, we love to talk and share our diverse cultures. If you go, I’m sure you’ll come back with some new friends!
